This is a simple Java program that allows you to input a sudoku board to solve, and then utilizes a backtracking algorithm to solve the inputted board. My algorithm is also
capable of identifying unsolvable boards, in which case it will return a board with red-shaded cells. See demo below; the first board is of medium difficulty, and the last
board is considered one of the hardest boards for humans to solve.
